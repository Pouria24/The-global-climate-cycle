# 1. the simplest possible model to show how the carbon reservoirs and fluxes change with time, which tracks just the major carbon reservoirs and *natural* fluxes
# 2. one that includes [anthropogenic](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/anthropogenic) (i.e., human-caused) fluxes of carbon (which should be an extension of the first model), with a function that controls the flux of human-generated carbon over time.
# 
# Think about how you will initialize the simulation, how you will evolve it in time, and how you will stop it.  Also, make sure to think about how you will keep track of the amount of carbon in each reservoir!
# 
# **Note:** This is meant to be a set of simple update equations, and should *not* be solved using odeint (you don't have quite enough information to create a model that is solvable in that manner).  As an example, if you had two carbon reservoirs, R$_A$ and R$_B$, and a flux F$_{A \rightarrow B}$ showing the amount of carbon per year that goes from reservoir A to reservoir B, the update equations would be:
# 
# $$ R_{A}^{N+1} = R_{A}^{N} - F_{A \rightarrow B} \Delta t $$
# 
# $$ R_{B}^{N+1} = R_{B}^{N} + F_{A \rightarrow B} \Delta t $$
# 
# with the times N and N+1 being separated by an amount of time $\Delta t$, and the changed signs in the flux indicating that if reservoir A gets larger, B must get smaller (and vice versa).
# 
# **Before you move forward with implementation, talk to one of the instructors to make sure you're on the right track!**

# ### Step 3 - Making some predictions about CO$_2$ and temperature
# 
# Next, connect your model of the carbon cycle to the simple model that you made in the last class, which relates the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration to global temperature.  Consider a few scenarios, and show how the various carbon reservoirs and the global mean temperature evolve over time, starting in the year 2000 with 
# an atmospheric CO$_2$ concentration of 368 parts per million (ppm), an average global temperature was 15Â° C, and the climate sensitivity factor, S, that you estimated from data in the last class.  The scenarios that we will consider will evolve until the year 2100.  Use the following models:
# 
# 1.  **Baseline model:** A constant 9 gigatons of carbon per year is put into the atmosphere by humans
# 2.  **Growth model:** The amount of carbon put into the atmosphere actually grows: starting at 7 gigatons/year in 2000, and increasing by 0.1 gigatons/year for every additional year thereafter (to represent increased reliance on fossil fuels).
# 3.  **"Get it under control" model:** The amount of carbon put into the atmosphere starts at 7 gigatons/year in 2000, increases by 0.1 gigatons/year until 2020, and then decreases by 0.1 gigatons/year until 2100.
# 4.  **"Carbon sequestration" model:** The amount of carbon put into the atmosphere starts at 7 gigatons/year in 2000, increases by 0.1 gigatons/year until 2020, and then decreases by 0.5 gigatons/year until it reaches -5 gigatons/year (indicatin that we have developed some means of "sequestering" carbon -- in other words, removing it from the atmosphere.
# 
# Make plots of the global atmospheric CO$_2$ concentration, average global atmospheric temperature, and mass of carbon in each reservoir for each of these scenarios, plotted on the same subplot.  Create a key for the plots so we can tell which lines correspond to which scenario!
